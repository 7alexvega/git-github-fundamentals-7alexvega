# The Basics of GitHub
---
Hello professor Giacalone,
I have completed the course on GitHub basics.
<br/>

## What I learned
- While going through the course I learned about GitHub's features
  - For example I learned how forking and pull requests could help collaboration
  - I also understood the idea of "branching" and how it could help overall workflow of projects
<br/>

## Inquiries
- Although I understand how GitHub can be an extremely useful tool for working on group projects I guess I am still unsure on how to use GitHub for group projects. I understand that groups working on a project can create branches to work on separate parts. My confusion is how everyone stay on the same page (what if one person's changes affects someone who working on a different part of the project).
